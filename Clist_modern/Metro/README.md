## Comment
Skin was made to suit Windows 10 dark theme.
If you want to use it with only avatars visiable, think about using icon overlay feature (preview 1)
There is also mute/unmute icon, it's commented out in metro.msf file. If you want to use it, delete ";" from this line:
;#SoundOnOff=sSwitch,CList/ToggleSound,Skin/UseSound,b1,-77,3,-55,25,R-R-I,0,0,Enable/disable sounds
